This is my very **First blog** post and I would Like to put some light on the contents that I will be posting on this site. Well, being an **I.T Engineering** student I came through a lot of concepts of **Computer Science, Programming, Web Development**,etc which at first were quite confusing to me, I presume these concepts are equally confusing to most of us Engineering students with same background. I somehow got over(got well acquainted) with most of the confusing concepts of my programming/developing journey. So I would like to share the articles/blogs which I'll be writing mostly to help other aspiring developers to get rid of these common confusing concepts as well as would also discuss or write about Important things which all the engineering students would across in their programming and developing journey. Hope I might be helpful to other aspiring developers
